Description: The Investec Front End Developer Assesment theme for WordPress takes us to one custom post type used for the carousel and one widget for the footer copyright, featuring a plugin that adds an admin option page called “Investec” as a submenu under tools. Each displayed beautifully in their own unique way. Design details abound, starting with a tradional Investec color scheme and matching header images, beautiful typography and icons, and a flexible layout that looks great on any device, big or small.
